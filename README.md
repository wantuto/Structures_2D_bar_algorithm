# Structures_2D_bar_algorithm
Algorithm for solving structural problems, 2D bars

In this particular code we proceed to compute a structure with defined geometry, defined forces and defined fixed degree of freedom.
With this defined parameters this code can calculate the stress in each of the bars forming the structure and also the displacements obtained for each node and for each degrree of freedom.

For optimization, a function to calculate the total mass of the stucture was defined at the end of the program in section 4).
